# Cambridge Sports Analytics (CSA)

Welcome to the GitHub organization for **Cambridge Sports Analytics (CSA)** ‚Äî creators of the **Relevance-Based Prediction (RBP)** method.

We develop mathematical models, software libraries, and APIs that support high-context, explainable prediction systems, with applications in sports, finance, healthcare, education, and beyond.

At CSA, we believe predictions should not only be accurate ‚Äî they should be **understandable**, **transparent**, and **relevant to decision-making**.


## üî¨ What We Do

We develop tools, APIs, and research libraries that support:

- **Contextual comparability** over abstract statistical form  
- **Fit** to quantify the reliability of a prediction  
- **Relevance weighting** to surface the most meaningful data patterns  
- **Transparent explainability** ‚Äî you see what the model sees

Our flagship products include:

- **Prediction Vault** ‚Äî web-based access to RBP results and player insights  
- **CSA Prediction Engine** ‚Äî API for integrating RBP predictions into custom workflows  
- **CSA R&D Cluster** ‚Äî internal parallelized engine for large-scale testing and modeling


## üì¶ Core Public Repositories

This organization is structured around three layers:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `csa_prediction_engine` | API wrappers and endpoint clients |
| `csa_common_lib` | Shared utilities, enums, helpers, and data containers |
| `prediction_engine_quickstart` | Quickstart guide to using the CSA Prediction Engine |

We maintain both **local-first tooling** for in-house modeling and **cloud-ready APIs** for external partners.


## üîç What You‚Äôll Find Here

This organization hosts both internal tooling and client-facing examples:

- **Model dispatchers** and task runners for CPU clusters
- **API endpoints** for on-demand relevance-based predictions
- **Research utilities** for surfacing comparables and variable importance
- **Multi-threaded execution frameworks** for high-throughput evaluations

While many of our current deployments focus on sports performance forecasting, the underlying architecture is **domain-agnostic**.


## üß† How RBP Works

The Relevance-Based Prediction framework emphasizes **fit-over-form**, favoring **statistical comparables** and **relevance weighting** over classical methods or machine learning.

Key principles:
- No look-ahead bias
- Grounded in historical player performance
- Transparent, traceable modeling outcomes
